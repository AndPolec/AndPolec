### Hello World! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

I'm **Andrzej** â€“ a .NET Developer based in **WrocÅ‚aw, Poland**.

ðŸ’¡ I focus on building **practical, maintainable software** that solves real business problems. I mainly work with **C#, .NET, SQL Server**, and **Angular**, currently developing systems in the **railway industry**.

ðŸ§© Before coding full time, I spent **10+ years in sales and client relations** â€“ analyzing data, managing B2B partnerships, and training business partners. This experience taught me how companies operate and what users *really* need.

ðŸ›  In my free time, I enjoy deepening my programming skills, exploring new technologies, and learning by building.
